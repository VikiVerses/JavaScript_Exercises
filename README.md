This repository contains my solutions to JavaScript practice exercises.
The topics include variables, operators, conditions, loops, functions, arrays, and small algorithms.

📂 **Contents**

The exercises are organized by chapter numbers (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, etc.) and cover:

**Basic operations**
String concatenation, arithmetic with strings/numbers, charCodeAt, comparison operators.

**Variables**
Assignments, var, let, const.

**Conditions**

🚀 **How to Run**

You can run the exercises either in a browser or with Node.js.

**Option 1: Run in Browser**

Open your browser (Chrome/Firefox).

Press F12 to open Developer Tools.

Go to the Console tab.
